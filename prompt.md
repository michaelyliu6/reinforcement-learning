# 📝 README Generation Prompt

Use this prompt template to generate modern, technically sophisticated READMEs for ML/AI projects:

```
I want you to analyze my repository and create a README that effectively communicates technical sophistication while maintaining an approachable, modern tone. Use relevant emojis for section headers and tech stack items. The README should:

1. Start with a friendly yet technically precise overview
   - Add a relevant emoji (e.g., 🤖 for AI, 🧠 for ML)
   - Keep it casual but technically accurate
   - Show sophistication without being overly formal

2. Detail the implementations with clear sections:
   - Core algorithms/methods with their technical features
   - Advanced optimizations and improvements
   - Theoretical foundations and empirical results
   - Use emojis to categorize major sections (e.g., 🎯 for objectives, 🎲 for methods)

3. Highlight technical implementation details:
   - Architecture decisions and design patterns
   - Performance optimizations and benchmarks
   - Experiment tracking and analysis approaches
   - Engineering practices and code quality
   - Use emojis like 🛠️ for technical sections, ⚡ for performance

4. Document project structure clearly:
   - File organization with purpose
   - Key features and components
   - Dependencies and requirements
   - Use 📁 for structure, 🔧 for configuration

5. Present tech stack with personality:
   - Core frameworks with relevant emojis (e.g., 🔥 PyTorch, 🎮 Gymnasium)
   - Supporting libraries and their specific uses
   - Development tools and their benefits
   - Make it visually engaging with emojis

6. Include practical sections:
   - Quick start guide
   - Documentation overview
   - Implementation principles
   - Use emojis like 🏃‍♂️ for getting started, 💡 for notes

7. Future Work & Development Status:
   - Current progress (🚧 In Progress)
   - Planned features (📝 On the Roadmap)
   - Future ideas (💭 Future Ideas)
   - Clear status indicators with emojis

The README should feel modern and approachable while demonstrating deep technical understanding. Think "casual expert" - someone who deeply knows their stuff but explains it in an accessible way.

Please analyze my repository and generate a README following this style.
